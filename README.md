## [Rossmann Store Sales Prediction](https://github.com/marxcerqueira/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Kaggle-Rossman-Sales-Prediction)

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

An end-to-end Data Science project with a regression adapted for time series as solution was created five machine learning models to forecast the sales. Predictions can be accessed by users through a bot from the smartphone app Telegram.
